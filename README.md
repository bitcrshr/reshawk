# Welcome to reshawk ðŸ‘‹ [ABANDONED]

> A web solution for college students in residence halls.

## This project has been abandoned. :(
After doing a feasibility analysis, I found that there is vast competition in this sector and I could not hope to compete as a solo developer. However, it was a great learning experience for using React as well as Express, so I decided to keep it here.

## Get Up and Running

First things first, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/photonfighterlabs/reshawk.git
```

Then, navigate to `reshawk` and install all the dependencies (this may take a while):

```sh
npm i
```

Finally, to start the development server, run:

```sh
npm start
```
